## About

I'm a full-stack developer who enjoys building products that solve real problems. Over the past 10 years, I've focused on AI applications, data platforms, and developer tools — work that sits at the intersection of complex systems and clean user experiences.

As a 3x founder, I built pATCHES into a music education platform reaching 2M+ visitors. I like shipping things that people actually use.
